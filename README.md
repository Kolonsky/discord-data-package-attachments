# Discord data package attachments

This simple script will get all links from your Discord data package (`package.zip`) and download them.

## Usage

1. Put `package.zip` in cloned repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary modules. (Nodejs must be installed!)
3. Run `npm start` and wait until all files are downloaded. (May take a long time. Depends on your internet connection speed and attachemetns quantity).

All downloaded files will be in `/out` folder with unique id (to prevent duplicate file names).
